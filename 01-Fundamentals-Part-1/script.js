Assignment - LECTURE: Values and Variables
1. Declare variables called 'country','continent' and 'population' and assign their values according to your owncountry (population in millions)
2. Log their values to the console

Assignment - LECTURE: Data Types
1. Declare a variable called 'isIsland' and set its value according to your 
country. The variable should hold a Boolean value. Also declare a variable
'language', but don't assign it any value yet
2. Log the types of 'isIsland', 'population', 'country' and 'language'

Assignment - LECTURE: Basic Operators
1. If your country split in half, and each half would contain half the population, 
then how many people would live in each half?

3. Finland has a population of 6 million. Does your country have more people than 
Finland?
4. The average population of a country is 33 million people. Does your country 
have less people than the average country?

Coding Challenge #1

Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is 
calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg 
and height in meter).

Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both 
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about 
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.

Test data:
ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 
m tall.
ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 
m tall.
*/

// Solution

// Test for Data 1

let markMass = 78;
let markHeight = 1.69;
let johnMass = 92;
let johnHeight = 1.95;
let markBmi = markMass / markHeight ** 2;
let johnBmi = johnMass / johnHeight ** 2;
const markHigherBMI = markBmi > johnBmi;

console.log(markBmi, johnBmi, markHigherBMI);


/* Test for Data 2

let markMass = 95;
let markHeight = 1.88;
let johnMass = 85;
let johnHeight = 1.76;

let markBmi = markMass / markHeight ** 2;
let johnBmi = johnMass / johnHeight ** 2;
const markHigherBMI = markBmi > johnBmi;

console.log(markBmi, johnBmi, markHigherBMI);
